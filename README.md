Analyze the architecture design for memory disambiguation speculation and synchronization in 3O pipeline

## Contents

- [figure3_analysis.md](figure3_analysis.md) - Detailed analysis of Figure 3 from the ISCA 1997 paper "Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization of Data Dependences" by Andreas Moshovos et al., explaining why it represents a typical example of memory disambiguation challenges.

## Overview

This repository contains analysis and documentation related to memory disambiguation and speculation techniques in modern processor architectures, specifically focusing on out-of-order (3O) pipeline designs.

Memory disambiguation is a critical technique that allows processors to execute load and store instructions out of order while maintaining program correctness. The analysis focuses on dynamic data dependence speculation techniques and the synchronization mechanisms needed to avoid mis-speculation.
