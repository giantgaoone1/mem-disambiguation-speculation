# Project Summary

## Memory Disambiguation Speculation Architecture for 3-Stage Out-of-Order Pipeline

### Project Overview

This project implements a complete architecture for memory disambiguation speculation in a 3-stage out-of-order (3O) pipeline. The design addresses the fundamental challenge of executing memory operations out-of-order while maintaining correctness and maximizing performance through speculation.

### Problem Statement

In modern processors, memory operations (loads and stores) represent a significant bottleneck. Out-of-order execution can improve performance by executing loads before all earlier stores complete. However, this requires:

1. **Memory Disambiguation**: Determining whether a load conflicts with pending stores
2. **Speculation**: Executing loads optimistically when dependencies are unknown
3. **Synchronization**: Maintaining correct memory ordering semantics
4. **Memory-Level Parallelism**: Overlapping multiple memory operations

### Solution Architecture

#### Core Design Philosophy

The architecture implements **optimistic speculation** with **learning-based prediction**:

- Loads execute speculatively when dependencies are uncertain
- A Store Set predictor learns memory dependency patterns
- Violations trigger recovery and predictor updates
- Speculation throttles based on accuracy

### Key Features

#### 1. Memory Disambiguation (lsq.py, predictor.py)

**Load-Store Queue:**
- Circular buffer tracking all in-flight memory operations
- Address-based dependency checking
- Store-to-load forwarding when data is ready
- Support for speculation and recovery

**Store Set Predictor:**
- Learns which loads depend on which stores
- Uses SSIT (Store Set ID Table) and LFST (Last Fetched Store Table)
- Confidence-based speculation control
- Adapts to program behavior over time

**Prediction Accuracy:**
- Initial optimistic speculation
- Learns from violations
- Achieves high accuracy after training period

#### 2. 3-Stage Pipeline (pipeline.py)

**Issue Stage:**
- Instruction dispatch from program counter
- Reorder Buffer (ROB) allocation for precise exceptions
- LSQ entry allocation for memory operations
- Predictor query for speculation decision

**Execute Stage:**
- Address calculation for memory operations
- LSQ dependency search
- Speculative load execution
- Store data preparation
- MSHR allocation for cache misses

**Commit Stage:**
- In-order instruction retirement from ROB
- Speculation validation for loads
- Memory update for stores
- Recovery mechanism for violations

#### 3. Synchronization (synchronization.py)

**Memory Fences:**
- LFENCE: Load serialization
- SFENCE: Store serialization
- MFENCE: Full memory barrier
- Enforces ordering across fence boundaries

**Atomic Operations:**
- Compare-And-Swap (CAS)
- Atomic exchange (SWAP)
- Fetch-And-Add (FADD)
- Guarantees atomicity and ordering

**Store Buffer:**
- Buffers committed stores before memory write
- Provides forwarding to younger loads
- Enables store coalescing
- Participates in coherence protocol

**LL/SC Primitives:**
- Load-Link establishes reservation
- Store-Conditional validates reservation
- Enables lock-free synchronization

#### 4. Memory-Level Parallelism (mlp.py)

**MSHR (Miss Status Handling Registers):**
- Tracks up to N concurrent cache misses
- Merges requests to same cache line
- Enables hit-under-miss and miss-under-miss
- Supports both demand and prefetch requests

**Bank Conflict Detection:**
- Models banked cache organization
- Detects conflicts when multiple requests hit same bank
- Tracks bank busy cycles
- Reports conflict statistics

**Prefetch Queue:**
- Separate queue for hardware prefetch requests
- Prevents interference with demand requests
- Tracks prefetch accuracy and timeliness
- Supports confidence-based prefetching

**MLP Tracking:**
- Monitors average outstanding misses
- Reports peak memory-level parallelism
- Calculates MLP utilization
- Identifies parallelism opportunities

### Example Scenarios

The implementation includes 7 comprehensive scenarios:

1. **Independent Operations**: Speculative execution without conflicts
2. **Store-to-Load Forwarding**: Data forwarding from store to dependent load
3. **Speculation Violation**: Detection and recovery from incorrect speculation
4. **Memory Fences**: Ordering enforcement with fence instructions
5. **Memory-Level Parallelism**: Concurrent cache miss handling
6. **Atomic Operations**: CAS and fetch-and-add semantics
7. **Store Buffer**: Buffering and forwarding behavior

Each scenario demonstrates correct behavior and validates the implementation.

### Performance Characteristics

#### Typical Behavior

**With High Prediction Accuracy (>95%):**
- Near-zero speculation violations
- High IPC (instructions per cycle)
- Effective memory-level parallelism
- Low recovery overhead

**With Low Prediction Accuracy (<80%):**
- Frequent speculation violations
- Pipeline flushes reduce IPC
- Predictor learns and improves over time
- May throttle speculation

**Memory-Intensive Workloads:**
- High LSQ utilization
- Multiple concurrent MSHR entries
- Benefit from store-to-load forwarding
- MLP maximization critical

### Design Trade-offs

#### Complexity vs. Performance

| Aspect | Simple Design | Aggressive Design |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Predictor | 2-bit counter | Store Set with SSIT/LFST |
| Recovery | Full flush | Selective replay |
| LSQ Size | Small (8-16) | Large (32-64) |
| MSHRs | Few (2-4) | Many (8-16) |
| Performance | Lower IPC | Higher IPC |
| Area | Smaller | Larger |
| Power | Lower | Higher |

**This Implementation**: Balances simplicity with effectiveness
- Store Set predictor for good accuracy
- Full flush for simpler recovery
- Configurable LSQ/MSHR sizes
- Modular design for easy extension

#### Power Considerations

**Energy-Efficient Choices:**
- Speculation throttling based on accuracy
- Confidence counters prevent excessive speculation
- Prefetch queue limits useless prefetches
- Store buffer reduces memory traffic

**Energy Costs:**
- LSQ content-addressable memory (CAM) searches
- Speculative execution on wrong paths
- Recovery from violations
- Predictor table updates

### Future Enhancements
